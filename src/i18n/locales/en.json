        "date": "February 22, 2016",
        "excerpt": "According to Proclamation No. 983/2008 on Tax Administration, a taxpayer who is unable to pay their tax debt in full or in one installment may request an extension of the payment period from the Ministry of Revenue.",
        "fullContent": "According to Proclamation No. 983/2008 on Tax Administration, a taxpayer who is unable to pay their tax debt on time or in one installment may request an extension of the payment period from the Ministry of Revenue.\n\nTherefore, as clarified by the Ministry of Revenue, if a taxpayer is unable to pay their tax debt on time or in one installment, the Ministry may grant an extension of the payment period. This directive outlines the procedures for implementing this provision. It is appropriate to establish a fair and accountable system by entering into an extended payment agreement and ensuring proper procedures are followed.\n\nThe directive also details the conditions under which a tax payment extension may be granted or denied.\n\n1. Conditions for Granting a Tax Payment Extension:\nAccording to this directive, a tax payment extension agreement may be granted under the following conditions:\nâ¢ The taxpayer is unable to pay their tax debt in one installment.\nâ¢ The taxpayer is not at a high risk level when the tax assessment or tax calculation notice is issued.\nâ¢ The taxpayer provides a bank guarantee equivalent to the debt if their assets are seized or auctioned.\n\n2. Conditions for Denying a Tax Payment Extension:\nAccording to Sub-Article 1 of Article 5 of this directive, a tax payment extension will not be granted under the following conditions:\nâ¢ The tax debt is indirect tax or income tax to be deducted from the taxpayer's account.\nâ¢ The taxpayer has previously been granted a payment extension but failed to pay the debt within the agreed period without a valid reason.\nâ¢ The amount of tax debt requested for extension is subject to the taxpayer's compliance.\n\nAccording to Sub-Article 2 of Article 5 of this directive, the taxpayer must receive a written notification from the tax authority within 30 days of submitting the extension request, indicating the decision.\n\nRegarding the payment period and installment plan, if the taxpayer demonstrates that they are unable to pay due to reasons beyond their control, the extension may be granted for up to three months. However, if the taxpayer requests the same extension for three consecutive tax periods, the tax debt payment period will not be extended.\n\nThe directive also specifies how and when the tax debt payment period will be determined when a tax calculation notice is issued and an extension agreement is entered into.\n\n- For high-level taxpayers, if the total principal tax, penalty, and interest debt ranges from 750,000 to 2.5 million Birr, the payment period may be extended for up to six months. For debts between 2.5 million and 3.75 million Birr, the extension may be up to eight months. For debts between 3.75 million and 5 million Birr, the extension may be up to ten months, and for debts above 5 million Birr, the extension may be up to twelve months.\n- For medium-level taxpayers, if the total principal tax, penalty, and interest debt ranges from 50,000 to 125,000 Birr, the payment period may be extended for up to three months. For debts between 125,000 and 750,000 Birr, the extension may be up to eight months. For debts between 2.5 million and 3.75 million Birr, the extension may be up to ten months, and for debts above 3.75 million Birr, the extension may be up to twelve months.\n- For small taxpayers, if the total principal tax, penalty, and interest debt ranges from 5,000 to 12,500 Birr, the payment period may be extended for up to three months. For debts between 12,501 and 75,000 Birr, the extension may be up to six months. For debts between 75,001 and 250,000 Birr, the extension may be up to eight months. For debts between 250,001 and 750,000 Birr, the extension may be up to ten months, and for debts above 750,000 Birr, the extension may be up to twelve months.\n- For micro taxpayers, if the total principal tax, penalty, and interest debt ranges from 1,000 to 10,000 Birr, the payment period may be extended for up to three months. For debts between 10,000 and 20,000 Birr, the extension may be up to six months. For debts between 20,000 and 40,000 Birr, the extension may be up to eight months. For debts between 40,001 and 60,000 Birr, the extension may be up to ten months, and for debts above 60,001 Birr, the extension may be up to twelve months.\n\nThis directive also outlines the procedures for submitting extension requests and the conditions that must be met:\n- A taxpayer requesting a tax payment extension must pay at least 25% of the tax debt as a down payment.\n- If the taxpayer's assets have been seized, they must pay the costs incurred by the tax authority and at least 25% of the tax debt as a down payment. The seizure may only be lifted if the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee equivalent to the debt.\n- If the taxpayer disagrees with the tax decision notice, they may file a complaint with the Tax Appeal Division or the Tax Appeal Commission. The tax paid during the appeal process will be credited toward the down payment and the remaining debt.\n- This directive also provides additional explanations and procedures for special cases where a tax payment extension may be granted.\n\nIn special cases, extension requests must be submitted to the branch office, which will forward the request along with the taxpayer's payment history and reasons for the extension to the Tax Debt Administration Directorate. The Directorate will then submit the decision to the Minister or their representative, who may reduce the down payment to 15% based on the taxpayer's financial situation. This process also applies to the revenue authorities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.\n\nThis directive provides detailed provisions on the tax payment extension process and its implementation based on the taxpayer's circumstances.",

Any person providing receipt printing services must verify that the receipts have been registered with the tax authority before printing them upon the taxpayer's request.\n\nIn general, any taxpayer required to maintain accounting records must issue receipts for their transactions and retain the necessary information.\n\nIn our city, notices such as 'Do not pay without a receipt!' are commonly seen in cafes, restaurants, beverage stores, and other businesses. These notices encourage the public to demand receipts. However, how many of us actually request or accept receipts when conducting transactions? How accountable are we in reporting transactions conducted without receipts to the relevant government authorities? Requesting and accepting receipts is not only our right but also a guarantee for our purchases. Conducting transactions without receipts creates unnecessary pressure on the legal business system and government revenue. Working together to prevent this is the only solution.",
