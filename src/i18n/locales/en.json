        "date": "June 15, 2024",
        "excerpt": "According to **Proclamation No. 983/2008** on Tax Administration, it has been established that a taxpayer who is unable to pay their tax liability in full or in a lump sum may request an extension of the payment period from the Ministry of Revenue.",
        "fullContent": "According to **Proclamation No. 983/2008** on Tax Administration, it has been established that a taxpayer who is unable to pay their tax liability in full or in a lump sum may request an extension of the payment period from the Ministry of Revenue. Accordingly, in relation to the directive issued by the Ministry of Revenue, it is understood that when a taxpayer is unable to pay their tax liability in full or in a lump sum, the Ministry may grant an extension of the payment period. This directive has been issued to implement this provision. When a taxpayer is unable to pay their tax liability in a lump sum, it is appropriate to create a fair and accountable system by entering into an extended payment agreement and establishing a responsible operational procedure. This directive also details the conditions under which an extension of the tax payment period may be allowed or prohibited. Conditions Under Which Tax Payment Extensions Are Allowed: - The taxpayer is unable to pay their tax liability in a lump sum. - The taxpayer is not in a high-risk category at the time of receiving the tax assessment or tax calculation notice. - The taxpayer has requested to pay their tax liability and has provided a bank guarantee equivalent to the liability, especially when their assets are seized or auctioned due to high-risk categorization. Conditions Under Which Tax Payment Extensions Are Not Allowed: - The tax liability is not a direct tax or is subject to withholding from the taxpayer's account. - The taxpayer has previously been granted a payment extension but failed to pay within the agreed period without a valid reason. - The amount of tax liability for which the extension is requested is subject to the taxpayer's discretion. Additionally, the taxpayer must respond within 30 days of receiving the tax payment extension decision from the tax authority. If the taxpayer fails to respond within this period, the extension request will be denied. Duration of Payment Extensions: The directive specifies the duration of payment extensions based on the taxpayer's category and the amount of tax liability: - For High Taxpayers: - Tax liability between **750,000 ETB and 2.5 million ETB**: Up to **6 months**. - Tax liability between **2.5 million ETB and 3.75 million ETB**: Up to **8 months**. - Tax liability between **3.75 million ETB and 5 million ETB**: Up to **10 months**. - Tax liability above **5 million ETB**: Up to **12 months**. - For Medium Taxpayers: - Tax liability between **50,000 ETB and 125,000 ETB**: Up to **3 months**. - Tax liability between **125,000 ETB and 750,000 ETB**: Up to **8 months**. - Tax liability between **2.5 million ETB and 3.75 million ETB**: Up to **10 months**. - Tax liability above **3.75 million ETB**: Up to **12 months**. - For Small Taxpayers: - Tax liability between **5,000 ETB and 12,500 ETB**: Up to **3 months**. - Tax liability between **12,501 ETB and 75,000 ETB**: Up to **6 months**. - Tax liability between **75,001 ETB and 250,000 ETB**: Up to **8 months**. - Tax liability between **250,001 ETB and 750,000 ETB**: Up to **10 months**. - Tax liability above **750,000 ETB**: Up to **12 months**. - For Micro Taxpayers: - Tax liability between **1,000 ETB and 10,000 ETB**: Up to **3 months**. - Tax liability between **10,000 ETB and 20,000 ETB**: Up to **6 months**. - Tax liability between **20,000 ETB and 40,000 ETB**: Up to **8 months**. - Tax liability between **40,001 ETB and 60,000 ETB**: Up to **10 months**. - Tax liability above **60,001 ETB**: Up to **12 months**. Implementation of Payment Extensions: The extension of the payment period becomes effective after the taxpayer and the tax authority sign a payment agreement. If the taxpayer fails to meet the terms of the agreement, they may not be granted another extension. Additionally, the taxpayer must pay at least **25% of the tax liability** upfront to qualify for an extension. If the taxpayer's assets have been seized, they must provide a bank guarantee equivalent to the tax liability to lift the seizure. The directive also outlines the process for appealing tax decisions and how payments made during the appeal process will be credited toward the tax liability. Special Cases: In special cases, the taxpayer may request a further extension by submitting a request to the branch office. The branch office will review the taxpayer's payment history and the reasons for the request, then forward the case to the Tax Debt Administration Directorate. The Directorate will make a recommendation to the Minister or their representative, who may reduce the upfront payment requirement to **15%** of the tax liability. Enforcement in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa: The directive also applies to the revenue authorities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, which will follow the same procedures as outlined above. Penalties for Non-Compliance: If a taxpayer fails to comply with the terms of the payment extension agreement, they will not be eligible for another extension. Additionally, penalties for late payment under **Article 105** of the Tax Administration Proclamation will not apply if the taxpayer adheres to the terms of the agreement.",

        "fullContent": "1. Taxable Rental Income\nTaxable rental income refers to the income derived by a taxpayer from renting out a property during the tax year, after deducting the total allowable expenses for the taxpayer.

Rental Payments Covering More Than One Year\nIf a lessor or sublessor receives rental income covering more than one year under Article 15(5) of the Proclamation, the total rental income is considered as received in the tax year it was received. However, the tax on this income is calculated by dividing it over the tax years it covers.\n\n8. Rental of Business Assets\nIncome derived from renting out business assets, including goods, equipment, and properties, as part of the normal business operations, is taxable under Schedule 'C' of the Proclamation.",

Any person providing receipt printing services must verify that the receipts have been registered with the tax authority before printing them upon the taxpayer's request.\n\nIn general, any taxpayer required to maintain accounting records must issue receipts for their transactions and retain the necessary information.\n\nIn our city, notices such as 'Do not pay without a receipt!' are commonly seen in cafes, restaurants, beverage stores, and other businesses. These notices encourage the public to demand receipts. However, how many of us actually request or accept receipts when conducting transactions? How accountable are we in reporting transactions conducted without receipts to the relevant government authorities? Requesting and accepting receipts is not only our right but also a guarantee for our purchases. Conducting transactions without receipts creates unnecessary pressure on the legal business system and government revenue. Working together to prevent this is the only solution.",
